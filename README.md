# Base-game mappings of Java Minecraft Edition
**No modifications, No Fabric API, Straight to the point...**

This repository is designed to provide developers, either at a byte-code level or modding the game to create new features, with breathing room for modifying the game further than what is presented to you by Fabric API or SpigotMC.
While you can use Mixins to effectively inject code into the game, its typically only supported by Forge modding; thus, this repository ensures individuals can work directly on the game code.

## Why is this good?

Below is an example class which handles authorisation to a specific server. An example program could be intercepting someone getting "deopped" which could potentially trigger an SQL transaction for storing an IP address of that suspicious person.
```java
package com.reeceturner.mappings.net.minecraft.server.dedicated;

/**
 * Mappings for the {@code net.minecraft.server.dedicated.DedicatedPlayerList} class.
 * This file is automatically generated. Do not edit.
 */
public final class DedicatedPlayerList {
    private DedicatedPlayerList() {}

    public static final String ORIGINAL_NAME = "net.minecraft.server.dedicated.DedicatedPlayerList";
    public static final String OBFUSCATED_NAME = "arh";

    public static final class Fields {
        private Fields() {}
        public static final String LOGGER = "h";
    }

    public static final class Methods {
        private Methods() {}
        public static final String CLINIT = "<clinit>";
        public static final String INIT_DEDICATED_SERVER_LAYERED_REGISTRY_ACCESS_PLAYER_DATA_STORAGE = "<init>";
        public static final String CAN_BYPASS_PLAYER_LIMIT_GAME_PROFILE = "d";
        public static final String DEOP_GAME_PROFILE = "b";
        public static final String GET_SERVER = "c";
        public static final String GET_SERVER_2 = "b";
        public static final String IS_WHITE_LISTED_GAME_PROFILE = "c";
        public static final String LOAD_IP_BAN_LIST = "y";
        public static final String LOAD_OPS = "A";
        public static final String LOAD_USER_BAN_LIST = "z";
        public static final String LOAD_WHITE_LIST = "C";
        public static final String OP_GAME_PROFILE = "a";
        public static final String RELOAD_WHITE_LIST = "a";
        public static final String SAVE_IP_BAN_LIST = "w";
        public static final String SAVE_OPS = "B";
        public static final String SAVE_USER_BAN_LIST = "x";
        public static final String SAVE_WHITE_LIST = "D";
        public static final String SET_USING_WHITE_LIST_BOOLEAN = "a";
    }
}
```

# To do:
- Add injection methods for simplifying programming paradigms.
